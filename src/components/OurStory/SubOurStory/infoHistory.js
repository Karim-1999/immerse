        text:"Here's where the Immerse story gets really interesting. In what felt like a blink of an eye, two major shifts happened in the world: the Covid-19 pandemic completely disrupted the traditional education model + Facebook rebranded to Meta. To capitalize on this cultural moment and shift in the global market, Immerse raised $9M (100% from social impact investors) to pivot the company to become the world's first ever direct-to-consumer language immersion brand. Since the closing of our fundraising we have expanded our team, launched VR Spanish learning on the Meta VR app store and already have cultivated a community of over 100 recurring Members."

We plan to launch more languages, integrate an in-app token reward system and launch brand partnerships that enhance the cultural experience for our growing Member community. Upward and onward for immersive education in the metaverse!"
